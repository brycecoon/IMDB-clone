# IMDB-clone
intro web dev final project

My project is meant to be similar to IMDB where you can
see different types of movies and search up existing movies
to see things like ratings, description, and explore 
new movies and genres

I chose this because I love movies. I really enjoy seeing new
movies and exploring new things. Before I watch a new movie
I almost always look up its ratings and what it's about and 
I watch the trailer for a bit so I get good use out of IMDB

Ambitious version is after what I have planned I would write
out the user's preferences to a file to save what they like and
maybe even write an algorithm that chooses new movies based on
previous searches. I would make it look better and even display 
all movies of an actor when you click on their name

My target is to make the css look clean and professional. 
I already work with the api to display movies, tv shows and 
different actors. I still need to make the genre buttons work
and filter searches to display current movies. Maybe I'll add
search checkboxes to display exactly what you want

smallest useful version would just be displaying movies in theatres and maybe a couple
genre searches.
